# GT3IMGSEditor
A tool for editing the IMGS archives found inside GT3. All code is generated by ChatGPT, using research on the file format by me.
The IMGS archive contains texture files, mainly used for the race HUD graphics. The utility is designed to only work on the final version of the IMGS format with 64 byte file entries, instead of the beta 32 byte entries.

Usage:
Building an archive:
GT3IMGSEditor.exe or simply running the executable. The utility will assume the extracted image data exists in a folder in the same directory as the executable.

Extracting an archive:
GT3IMGSEditor.exe file.imgs (path to file)
````
